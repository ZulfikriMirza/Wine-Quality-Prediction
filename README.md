# Wine-Quality-Prediction
**Predict The Quality of Wine with Random Forest Classifier Machine Learning Project**

Finding the Quality of the wine using several chemical parameters like acidity, citric, acid content, sugar content, etc. using **Random Forest Classifier**

**Random Forest model** is one of the most important supers learning alghoritm in machine learning

Random forest is ensemble model that use more than two or three models in combination for prediction

We use 1599 Row and 12 Columns Data

Even tho the quality is from 3-8 in this time i will only use 2 binary value instead 6 because binary value will give better result to the model

so we will use 1 if the value/quality is 7 or more than 7 but other than that it will be 0
